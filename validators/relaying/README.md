# Relayers

## IBC Channels

To enable transfers of the Juno token between various cosmos blockchains, the Juno team will create official IBC channels which will be used for integrations.
Being the IBC Channel creation totally permissionless, if you notice that a channel is missing you can also create that one for your own, but as a best practice advice, ask before on discord on #ðŸ”ƒï¸±relayers-ibc channel.

Considering the fast evolution of the IBC connections, in order to have an updated view of active channels to setup you can use directly mintscan:

## Relayer Tutorials

To assist operators in setting up relayers, the Juno team have provided tutorials for the following IBC relayers:

{% content-ref url="ibc-go.md" %}
[ibc-go.md](ibc-go.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="hermes.md" %}
[hermes.md](hermes.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Network configurations for relayers are stored in the mainnet Github repository.
{% endhint %}
